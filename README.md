# InternationalProjectSPM295
This was a collaborative project for SPM 295 Research Methodology completed with classmates Ben Phillips, Cooper Shawver, and Drake Mills

SPM 295 Research Methodology is a course offered by Syracuse University that I completed in Fall of 2020. In project 1 students are assigned to group up and complete a 
research project of their choosing. My group featuring Ben Phillips, Cooper Shawver, adn Drake Mills decided to research internationality in Major League Baseball. We 
pursued the general research question of "Does Player Nationality Influence Unique Statistical Performance?" 

Career Hitting and Pitching data was obtained from FanGraphs Leaderboards, and Internationality data was collected from Chadwick Bureau's People data file linked here 
https://github.com/chadwickbureau/register/blob/master/data/people.csv

All Coding was completed in R. My contributions to the collaborative effort are listed and entitled SPM 295 International Baseball Project.R. A copy of the paper is 
also listed and entitled Preston_spm295_project.pdf. The FanGraphs career leaderboards data is listed and entitled FangraphsCareerLeaders.zip
